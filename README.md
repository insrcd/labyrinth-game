# Labyrinth Brewery - THE GAME

A few of my buds at my local brewery (http://lbc.beer) are making a beer of my own specification, so I decided to make them a video game. I am not a video game developer; I work for a pretty fantastic company called Slalom doing enterprise / custom app development. I'm just a dude who once wrote a MUD in C to learn how it in the 90s. I thought, the best way to learn https://www.rust-lang.org/ was to make a game.

My timing was impeccable, because at the exact moment, https://bevyengine.org/ was released to the world. It is an ECS and rendering engine that's brand new, and super sweet. It focuses on ergonomics, which is  (in my opinion) one of the most important aspect of developing stuff. I'm hoping that me struggling through how to implement basic stuff (like Zooming, tile placement, mouse movement and position normalization, sprite interaciton, ECS queries, etc) will help others as Bevy becomes more mature.

The game will be a market similuation / roguelike hybrid. You, the Hero, will decend into the recently discovered caverns below the Labyrinth Brewery in Manchester, Connecticut. In the labyinth, you can gather materials for your next craft beer or cider recipe, new items to destroy epic monsters, and other generic roguelike stuff. If you parish during the depths you will find yourself on the Bar Room floor, with all of your recipes and improvements but all of your items will be gone! You may have to deal with a rowdy bar guest from time to time as well.

The owners of Labyrinth Brewery are highly involved in local community and great causes (like Interval House (https://intervalhousect.org/), Black Lives Matter, the CT Bail Project to name a few) and I am trying to involve our local artist and writing community to make this project successful. If this project is ever monitized, any revenue will go to the same causes that Labyrinth cares about, as well as locally commissioned artists and writers

Currently, this codebase is merely being used to design the basic systems and datatypes needed for the game. It is going to leverage the rust scripting engine RHAI for NPC / Powers / AI development.

So, join us in solving the mystery of the Labyrinth Below Labyrinth!

## Keybindings

W,A,S,D - Move the player around

`; and '` - cycle through tile categories (Lab-Builder)

`[ and ]` - cycle through tiles in the current category

`+ / -`   - Set the Z axis of new tiles

Scroll Wheel Up / Scroll Wheel Down - Zoom in and out

## Contribution

If you want to contribute, please create issues or pull requests. Since I am doing this to learn, I'm doing a lot of things wrong. I've read a lot of documentation on rust and a lot of source code to try and make what I create as idiomatic as possible, but I'm going to do things differently or wrong - a lot! My background is mostly Java / C# and Kotlin so my mindset is heavily inspired by functional and OOP. All I ask for is kindness and understanding and patience from anyone who interacts with this project. Any suggestions are welcome!

## Quickstart for Development

- clone the repo
- install https://rustup.rs/
- run ```rustup override set nightly``` in the repo directory
- run ```cargo run --release``` in the same place

Depending on your development environment there may be some "gotchyas" based on your video card, operating system, etc, check out https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy for current issues with your environment.

## Goals 

- A roguelike / Market Simulation game. Explore, battle stuff, get stuff, make stuff, sell stuff.
- A custom sprite for every Regular and Employee of Labyrinth
- NPC Mobs based on Labyrinth Brewery myth - Demanding Customers, Celler Trolls, Beer Wizards, and Cantankerous Owners
- A highly customizable scripting / dialog engine so a good story can be told
- Involve local artists to design quests, concept art and sprites.

## What's Done
- Short Demo showing interaction / inventory / Map Builder.
- Start of a Map / World Editor
- Tile Blueprints
- Sprite Library / Tile Palette for easy / named access of assets
- Zoom
- Mouse Click Locations
- Basic NPC Movement
- Extensible Component Interactions
- GUI Text System
- Cargo refactoring
- Some of the World Entity definition (Objects, Items, etc)

## TODO

- Dialog System
- Menu System
- NPC Interaction System
- Combat
- Market Simulation
- Procedural Generation of Labyrinth
- Bar Room Sprites / Map
- Custom Sprites for NPCs / Regulars
- Scripting Integration
- Testing, Testing, Testing (Becasuse Bevy and this game are new, I'm focusing on banging out as much code as possible, but I am a TDD wonk so I will be putting out tests once the environment stabilizes)

## Thanks
- My wonderful, supportive wife, Hadria Beth (https://hadriabeth.com) who will be responsible for quite a bit of the sprite art in the game.
- Carter Anderson (@cart_cart) for his hard work on Bevy, thank you for making a engine that even a novice Rust dev can adopt.
- All helpful folks in the Bevy discord channel, my experience in the community so far has been amazing, and I'm learning a great deal about the game dev world.

## Sprite Sheet Thanks

Until I can get some sprites made specificially for the game, I am using openly available spritesheets (well, one that is not so open but I'm working on replacing it asap), and here is the list of thanks to these amazing artists who make their work available to game devs.
